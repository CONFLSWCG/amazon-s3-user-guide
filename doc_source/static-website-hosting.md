# How Do I Configure an S3 Bucket for Static Website Hosting?<a name="static-website-hosting"></a>

You can host a static website on Amazon S3\. On a static website, individual web pages include static content and they might also contain client\-side scripts\. By contrast, a dynamic website relies on server\-side processing, including server\-side scripts such as PHP, JSP, or ASP\.NET\. Amazon S3 does not support server\-side scripting\.

The following is a quick procedure to configure an Amazon S3 bucket for static website hosting in the S3 console\. If youâ€™re looking for more in\-depth information, as well as walkthroughs on using a custom domain name for your static website or speeding up your website, see [Hosting a Static Website on Amazon S3](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html) in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide*\.

**To configure an S3 bucket for static website hosting**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/)\.

1. In the **Bucket name** list, choose the name of the bucket that you want to enable static website hosting for\.

   After you enable your bucket for static website hosting, web browsers can access all of your content through the Amazon S3 website endpoint for your bucket\.

1. Choose **Use this bucket to host**\. 

   1. For **Index Document**, type the name of the index document, which is typically named `index.html`\. When you configure a bucket for website hosting, you must specify an index document\. Amazon S3 returns this index document when requests are made to the root domain or any of the subfolders\. For more information, see [Configure a Bucket for Website Hosting](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/HowDoIWebsiteConfiguration.html) in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide*\.

   1. \(Optional\) For 4XX class errors, you can optionally provide your own custom error document that provides additional guidance for your users\. For **Error Document**, type the name of the file that contains the custom error document\. If an error occurs, Amazon S3 returns an HTML error document\. For more information, see [Custom Error Document Support](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/CustomErrorDocSupport.html) in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide*\.

   1. \(Optional\) If you want to specify advanced redirection rules, in the **Edit redirection rules** text area, use XML to describe the rules\. For example, you can conditionally route requests according to specific object key names or prefixes in the request\. For more information, see [Configure a Bucket for Website Hosting](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/HowDoIWebsiteConfiguration.html) in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide*\.

1. Choose **Save**\.

1. Add a bucket policy to the website bucket that grants everyone access to the objects in the bucket\. When you configure a bucket as a website, you must make the objects that you want to serve publicly readable\. To do so, you write a bucket policy that grants everyone `s3:GetObject` permission\. The following example bucket policy grants everyone access to the objects in the `example-bucket` bucket\.

   ```
   {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Principal": "*",
               "Action": [
                   "s3:GetObject"
               ],
               "Resource": [
                   "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*"
               ]
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

   For information about adding a bucket policy, see [How Do I Add an S3 Bucket Policy?](add-bucket-policy.md)\. For more information about website permissions, see [Permissions Required for Website](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteAccessPermissionsReqd.html) in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide*\. 

**Note**  
If you choose **Disable website hosting**, Amazon S3 removes the website configuration from the bucket, so that the bucket is no longer accessible from the website endpoint\. However, the bucket is still available at the REST endpoint\. For a list of Amazon S3 endpoints, see [Amazon S3 Regions and Endpoints](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*\.
